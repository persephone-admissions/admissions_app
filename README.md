# General Assembly Persphone Admissions App

##Description:
The Persephone Admissions App guides both prospective students and General Assembly employees through the application process. Students start by creating a password-protected account. Once logged in, they can apply for various courses by uploading and submitting text files via the student portal. 
<br><br>
The next step is for one of GA's admissions officers to conduct a 10-minute phone interview. They'll access the course's phone interview questionnaire, which can be edited beforehand, and then submit answers based on the student's responses.
<br><br>
After the phone interview, one of the course's instructor's will conduct a 50-minute in-person interview, using a different questionnaire and form (also editable).
<br><br>
Once the application process has begun, a prospective student will receive an email inviting them to log into the student panel and check the status of their submission. It will also alert them to any next steps.
